Aitu - a "programming language" that is usable for every programming language

# Can you write in this universal programming language by hand?
Yes, but it is hard. First, you have to memorize your ASCII char code table, as it is the heart of the project. Whatever letters you want to write, have to be 5 plus the original char code.
So for example, A would be 65. 65 + 5 would be 70, and the char code for 70 is F.
